### Branch:

* A branch in Git repository is a pointer that is able to move and provide commits. Default branch in a newly created repository is Master, which is the main root of where the stored resources can be found. Branches can be created locally and are used to be committed into the repository. Once committed the changes can be merged in main branch “Master” to reflect the changes in the repository.
