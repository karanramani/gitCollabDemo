3. Fork - A fork is a copy of a repository that maintains a link with the origin repository so changes can be sent back 
to the original repository, even if it is on a different account.  This allows people to work on their own repositories 
and selectively submit changes back to the original.

4. Branch - A branch in Git repository is a pointer that is able to move and provide commits. 
Default branch in a newly created repository is Master, which is the main root of where the stored resources can be found. Branches can be created locally and are used to be committed into the repository. 
Once committed the changes can be merged in main branch “Master” to reflect the changes in the repository.
